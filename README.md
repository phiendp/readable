# Readable

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and frontend that power the whole application.

## Getting Started

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the frontend's codebase 
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

* Then, access http://localhost:3000 to run the frontend application.
